Welcome to the Ada Crypto Library (ACL) aka libadacrypt
=======================================================
This library is an ongoing project that provides the Ada community to
strong cryptography primitives and schemes, focused to ensure
data confidentiality and data integrity. 


Implemented Features
-----------------------
 - Symmetric Cryptography
   - Blockciphers: AES, Twofish, 3DES, Serpent
   - Modes of Operation : BPS, CFB, Ctr, OFB 
   - Tweakable Blockcipher Modes:  CMT, XT
   - Hash functions: SHA-1 (broken), SHA-256, (SHA-384), SHA-512, Whirlpool
   - MACs: RMAC, HMAC, CMAC
   - Authenticated Encryption schemes: OCB, SIV and McOE
   - Key Derivation Functions: PBKDF2, scrypt, and SHA-512crypt
 - Big (unsigned) number library
   - Primary cyclic group arithmetic  (Z_p)
   - Binary Field arithmetic support.
   - Elliptic Curve arithmetic
      - Supersingular Elliptic Curves Over Binary Fields  (SS-BF)
      - Non-Supersingular Elliptic Curves Over Binary Fields (NSS-BF)
      - Elliptic Curves Over Z_p (EC-Z_P)
 - Asymmetric Cryptography
   - Probabilistic primality testing
   - DSA signature scheme
   - OEAP-RSA 
   - ECDSA, ECDH
 - Nonce Generator Support: Random, Counter, Mixed
 - AUnit-3.4 based Test suite (over 400 tests, about 90% line coverage)


Getting started
-----------------
### Prerequisites 
 * GNAT-4.8 (recommended version: 4.9)
 * GNU Make (recommended version: 4)
 * gcov (recommended version: 4.8.3; optional for testing only)
