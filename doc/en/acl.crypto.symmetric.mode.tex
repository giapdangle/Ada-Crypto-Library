\chapter{Crypto.Symmetric.Mode}\label{Mode}
With this package it is possible to work with a block cipher in a secure operating mode. Generally an operating mode integrates a block cipher with a feedback and some easy operations ($+,xor$), and will be initialized with a random start value (IV). Thus the ciphertext depends not only on plaintext and key, but also on the random start value. If man encrypts twice a plaintext with the same cipher key but different IVs, then man gets different ciphertexts. With the feedback that two same plaintext blocks will be encrypted to different ciphertext blocks, i.e. in an operating mode two plaintext blocks $P_1$ and $P_2$ with $P_1=P_2$ are encrypted, with absolute probability to two ciphertext blocks $C_1$ and $C_2$ with $C_1\neq C_2$. For this reason it is now possible to encrypt more messages securely under the same key.\\
\textbf{Remark: To decrypt a ciphertext, man needs the same key and IV which used in encryption.} One should always keep the IV with the related ciphertext. \textbf{The security of a mode is independent on the familarity of the start value.} Therefore it is in general, that man concatenates the ciphertext to the end of the start value to get the final output $C'$ ($C'=IV||C$). In this chapter several kinds of modes will be introduced.
\section{API}\label{API-Mode}
The API of a mode is made of four procedures.
\begin{itemize}
\item One procedure \texttt{Init()}; it initializes a mode by assigning a key and an initial value.
\begin{lstlisting}{}
  procedure Init(Key : in Key_Type; Initial_Value : in Block);
\end{lstlisting}
\item One procedure \texttt{Encrypt()}; 
\begin{lstlisting}{}
  procedure Encrypt(Plaintext: in Block; Ciphertext: out Block);
\end{lstlisting}
\item One procedure \texttt{Decrypt()};
\begin{lstlisting}{}
  procedure Decrypt(Ciphertext: in Block; Plaintext: out Block);
\end{lstlisting}
\item One procedure \texttt{Set\_IV()}; it assigns the start value. The mode should be reinitialized after every encryption or decryption (A message is made of $n$ plaintext blocks, which corresponds with $n$ calls of the \texttt{Encrypt()} or \texttt{Decrypt()} procedures).
\begin{lstlisting}{}
  procedure Set_IV(Initial_Value : in Block);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\section{Cipher Block Chaining Mode (CBC)}
\subsubsection*{Package: Crypto.Symmetric.Mode.CBC}
In the CBC mode, each block of plaintext will be XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted (for the first time XORed with an initial value). This way, each outputed ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point \cite{DBLP:reference/crypt/2011}. 
\subsubsection*{Encryption}
Mathematical description: $C_i=E_K(P_i\oplus C_{i-1})\,, C_0=IV$\,.\\
Figure \ref{CBCEN} shows the workflow of the CBC encryption.
By the initialization, the start value IV will be stored as $C_0$. A plaintext block $P_1$ is to encrypt, it will be XORed with $C_0$ and then encrypted to a ciphertext block $C_1$. The next plaintext block $P_2$ will XORed with $C_1$ and then encrypted to $C_2$ and so on.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Decryption}
Mathematical description: $P_i=C_{i-1}\oplus D_K(C_i)$.\\
Figure \ref{CBCDE} shows the decryption workflow of CBC. It's the reverse of encryption. At the beginning the mode will be initialized with IV or in \texttt{Set\_IV()} reinitialized. A ciphertext block $C_1$ will be decrypted and the output will be XORed with $C_0$. The result of the XOR operation is the plaintext block $P_1$. The next ciphertext block $C_2$ will be decrypted and the output will be XORed with $C_1$ as $P_2$ and so on. 
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Purpose of Use}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Data Encryption}\\
Since there can be no error by synchronization in this mode, it is useful for data encryption. However it can lead to bit errors (through defective hardware or the like). One bit error in a ciphertext block $C_i$ can influence the plaintext block $P_i$ and also the related bit in next plaintext block $P_{i+1}$.
\item \textbf{Message Integrity Testing}\\
In order to test the integrity of a message, we encrypt the message and only need to remember two ciphertext blocks: $C_0=IV$ and $C_n$. The remaining ciphertext blocks are not required. Now we can certify at any time by encrypting the message $M$ to $C'_n$ with the start value $C_0$ and compare $C_n$ with $C'_n$, whether the message is changed or not. If $C_n=C'_n$, then the message $M$ is the original one, otherweise at least one of $IV$, $C_n$ or $M$ is changed. "Changed" is understood as accidental tipping of one or more bits.
\item \textbf{Message Authenticity Testing}\\
Supposed that you tell Alice a key, who you'd never met before. And one day you want to meet Alice to exchange secret data. To ensure that the people at the meeting point is really Alice, you bring a message $M$ and a randomly start value $IV$. You ask Alice to encrypt the message to $C'_n$ with the key and the start value. If $C'_n$ agrees with your computed $C_n$ (neither you nor Alice has told anyone the key), then the person is with significant propability to be Alice. If the two values are not the same, then the person is not Alice.
\item \textbf{Notice: The CBC-Mode is only secure when the exchanged messages are at the same length.} So users should pay attention to use the CBC Mode.
\end{itemize}

\section{BPS}
\subsubsection*{Package: Crypto.Symmetric.Mode.BPS}
BPS is a generic format-preserving symmetric encryption algorithm, which can cipher short or long string of characters from any given set, e.g. credit card numbers.
\subsubsection*{Encryption and Decryption}
The main process is similar to the CBC mode with an IV set to 0.
Internally a 8-round encryption is used. The plaintext will be divided into two sub-strings $L,R$ of similar length, i.e. $P=L||R$, and each of them will be updated in turn \cite{BPS}. Decryption is also composed of 8 rounds. They work as shown in Figure \ref{BPSED}.\\
\begin{figure}[htp]
\center
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Pictures/BPS_En_De.pdf} 
\caption{Workflow of the internal encryption (Left) and decryption (Right) in the BPS. \cite{BPS}}\label{BPSED}
\center
\end{figure}
\subsection*{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item One advantage of BPS is its adaptability, all the block cipher and hash
function standardized primitives (TDES, AES or SHA-2) can be used as basic internal bricks \cite{BPS}. 
\item The internal tweak values is useful to avoid some kind of dictionary attacks \cite{BPS}. Indeed, if no tweak is used, a third party could build a dictionary of plaintext / ciphertext pairs and find with good probability the eavesdropped encrypted PANs (Personal Account Numbers), this attack works when the amount of data is small, which is particularly the case for an array of numbers encryption \cite{BPS}. "Using random tweak will render this dictionary technique useless as one dictionary per tweak value would be required" \cite{BPS}.
\item An essential quality of BPS is its efficiency. Due to that the input key for all the block cipher internal calls is constant, this requires only one internal cipher key per BPS encryption, which saves a lot of operations and time \cite{BPS}. Moreover, w = 8 rounds is recommanded, it makes the whole encryption process very efficient \cite{BPS}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB)}\label{CipherFeedbackMode}
\subsubsection*{Package: Crypto.Symmetric.Mode.CFB}
The cipher feedback (CFB) mode, a close relative of CBC, makes a block cipher into a self-synchronizing stream cipher \cite{DBLP:reference/crypt/2011}.
\begin{figure}[htp]
\center
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Pictures/CFB_En.pdf} 
\caption{Workflow of the CFB encryption. Adapted from \cite{DBLP:reference/crypt/2011}.}\label{CFBEN}
\center
\end{figure}\\
\subsubsection*{Encryption}
Mathematical description : $C_i=E_K(C_{i-1})\oplus P_i$, $C_0=IV$.\\
Figure \ref{CFBEN} shows the workflow of encryption in CFB. By initialization the start value IV will be stored as $C_0$. To encrypt a $n$ bit ($n<$ Block'Size) message, it will be copied in the plaintext block, and then padded with zeros. To encrypt a plaintext block $P_1$, the start value $C_0$ will be encrypted at first, and then XORed with $P_1$ and stored as $C_1$. Following plaintext blocks will be processed iteratively until the complete message is encrypted.
\subsubsection*{Decryption}
Mathematical description : $P_i=E_K(C_{i-1})\oplus C_i$, $C_0=IV$.\\
As shown in Figure \ref{CFBDE}, the decryption in CFB makes use of the encryption algorithm. At the beginning the mode will be initialized or through \texttt{Set\_IV()} reinitialized. To decrypt a ciphertext block $C_i$, $C_{i-1}$ will be decrypted at first and then XORed with $C_i$. The output of the operation is $P_i$.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Pictures/CFB_De.pdf} 
\caption{Workflow of the CFB decryption. Adapted from \cite{DBLP:reference/crypt/2011}.} \label{CFBDE}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Remarks}
In comparison with CBC-Mode, which can be used when a complete data block exists, CFB-Mode can be used to encrypt not only data but also bytes (8-CFB). Therefore it is mainly used for encryption of byte streams (e.g. Remote shell).\\
In n-CFB-Mode:
\begin{itemize}
\item an error in plaintext will affect the following complete ciphertext and in decryption it goes backward.
\item an error in ciphertext $C_i$ will affect the plaintext block $P_i$ and also the following $\frac{m}{n}-1$ plaintext blocks, where $m$ is the size of the message.
\item An aggressor can change the message bits in the last ciphertext block without being found.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Counter Mode (CTR)}\label{CounterMode}
\subsubsection*{Package: Crypto.Symmetric.Mode.CTR}
In Counter Mode the feedback isn't dependent on plaintext, but on a counter, which will be increased by 1 after every encryption. Note that the nonce in Figure \ref{CTREN} and Figure \ref{CTRDE} is the same thing as the initial vector (IV) in other graphs. 
\subsubsection*{Encryption}
Mathematical description : $C_i=P_i\oplus E_K(IV+i-1)$.\\
In Figure \ref{CTREN} the counter is initialized at first. The current counter $IV+i-1$ of each block is encrypted, the output is then XORed with plaintext block $P_i$, and the result is $C_i$.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Pictures/CTR_En.pdf} 
\caption{Workflow of the CTR encryption. Adapted from \cite{DBLP:reference/crypt/2011}.}\label{CTREN}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Decryption}
Mathematical description : $P_i=C_i\oplus E_K(IV+i-1)$.\\
Note that in Figure \ref{CTRDE} the encryption algorithm is used in decryption.
After initialization counter $IV+i-1$ will be encrypted, then the output will be XORed with $C_i$ and the result is $P_i$. It is done iteratively until the last block.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Pictures/CTR_De.pdf} 
\caption{Workflow of the CTR decryption. Adapted from \cite{DBLP:reference/crypt/2011}.}\label{CTRDE}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{En-/Decryption of Messages with Random Access}\\
Since that the counter mode is used to decrypt individual ciphertext block, this procedure is suitable for decryption of data with random access e.g. Database.
\item \textbf{Parallel En-/Decryption}\\
Parallelization is possible when man calculates an interval from the start value (IV) and the length of the message is $L$: $[IV\cdots IV+L]$. The interval is decomposed in max. $L$ disjunktive part intervals. Then the message blocks in the part intervals can be en-/decrypted parallel.
\item \textbf{Phasic "High Speed" Encryption}\\
This is a professional function that based on "Low-Level-API" (\ref{Low-Level}) of CTR mode. Please use this only when you konw what it does. In CTR mode it is possible to generate random keystream bits without a message block to be needed. When you generate enough keystream bits with the CTR mode, then you are able to encrypt the messages very quickly through being XORed with the already produced keystream bits.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Notice:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A bit error in plaintext will influence only one bit in ciphertext and vice versa.
\item Manipulation on plaintext is clear, because every change in ciphertext influences directly the plaintext.
\item Error in Synchronization (Alice and Bob are in different counter states) can not be solved. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Low-Level-API}\label{Low-Level}
This API can be used only when you know exactly what it does.
\begin{lstlisting}{}
  procedure Next_Block(Keystream : out Block);
\end{lstlisting}
Mathematical description : $C=E_K(Counter)$; $Counter:=Counter+1$.\\
It encrypts the internal counter to $C$, and the counter will be increased by 1.

\section{Output Feedback Mode (OFB)}\label{OutputFeedbackMode}
\subsubsection*{Package: Crypto.Symmetric.Mode.OFB}
The OFB mode converts a blockcipher in a stream cipher like the CTR mode. That is, the internal feedback is independent from the plaintext.
\subsubsection*{Encryption}
Mathematical description : $C_i=P_i\oplus K_i\,,\, K_i=E_K(K_{i-1})$.\\
In Figure \ref{OFBEN} shows the workflow of encryption in OFB.
$IV$ is assigned to an internal keystream block $K_0$. Block $K_{i-1}$ will be encrypted to $K_i$ and then XORed with $P_i$, and the result of the operation is ciphertext block $C_i$.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Pictures/OFB_En.pdf} 
\caption{Workflow of the OFB encryption. Adapted from \cite{DBLP:reference/crypt/2011}.}\label{OFBEN}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Decryption}
Mathematical description : $P_i=C_i\oplus K_i\,,\, K_i=E_K(K_{i-1})$.\\
The algorithm encryption is used in decryption as shown in Figure \ref{OFBDE}. The keystream block $K_0$ is initialized with the start value $IV$ or reinitialized by \texttt{Set\_IV()}. $K_{i-1}$ will be encrypted to $K_i$ and XORed with $C_i$. The result of the operation is the plaintext block $P_i$. These ciphertext blocks are decrypted in the same sequence in which they are generated.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Pictures/OFB_De.pdf} 
\caption{Workflow of the OFB decryption. Adapted from \cite{DBLP:reference/crypt/2011}.}\label{OFBDE}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Remarks}
With the "Low-Level-API" (\ref{Low-Level-OFB}) users can generate a keystream without plaintext blocks. Thereby they can encrypt the plaintext blocks very fast. For example it will be possible to generate keystream blocks at night and then encrypt plaintext blocks in the day time. So this mode is very suitable when phasic plaintext blocks should be encrypted quickly.
\subsubsection*{Notice:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The keystream repeats at any time. That is, $\exists L:K_0=K_L$. Supposed $m$ is the block size in bits, then the average length of a cycle goes to $2^m-1$ bits.
\item A bit error in plaintext will influence one bit in ciphertext and vice versa.
\item Manipulation on plaintext is clear, every change in ciphertext influences directly the plaintext.
\item Error in synchronization (Alice and Bob are in different counter states) can not be solved. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Low-Level-API}\label{Low-Level-OFB}
The following API can be used only when you know what it does.
\begin{lstlisting}{}
  procedure Next_Block(Keystream : out Block);
\end{lstlisting}
Mathematical description : $K_i=E_K(K_{i-1})$.\\
During initialization the start value IV is stored as keystream block $K_0$. Every time when the \texttt{Next\_Block()} procedure is called, the keystream block $K_i$ will be encrypted to $K_{i+1}$ and resulted as keystream.
