\chapter{Crypto.Asymmetric}
The distinguishing technique used in public-key cryptography is the
use of asymmetric key algorithms, where the key used to encrypt a
message is not the same as the key used to decrypt it. Each user has a
pair of cryptographic keys â€” a public encryption key and a private
decryption key. The publicly available encryption key is widely
distributed, while the private decryption key is known only to the
recipient. Messages are encrypted with the recipient's public key and
can be decrypted only with the corresponding private key.

In the ACL, asymmetric algorithms are also
provided. \texttt{Crypto.Asymmetric} is the root package for
asymmetric cryptosystem. It enables direct access to
\texttt{Crypto.Types} which contains fundamental types and
corresponding basic functions. Furthermore it provides access to
\texttt{Crypto.Types.Big\_Numbers}.
