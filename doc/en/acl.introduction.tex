\chapter{Introduction}
The Ada Crypto Lib (ACL) is a free cryptographic library written in Ada.
One of the two main design objectives of this library is to create
an \textbf{intuitive and clean API}. The other goal is to use a clean
programming style in order to actively support and simplify formal code
verification. Due to this, the ACL has been coded without the
following "features":
\begin{itemize}
\item inline assembler
\item tagged types (objects)
\item goto statements
\end{itemize}

Goto statements have been avoided as they make the source more complex
and might cause problems during formal verification of the code. No
tagged types have been used as procedures and methods may be
overwritten, and the actual method that is being utilised is
determined during runtime (dynamic dispatching). This results in
massive problems during formal code verification. Inline assembler has
been avoided cause it involves a very unclean programming style and
can be used for omitting the strict typing of Ada. Due to these
restrictions, the actual code quality increases with respect to
verification and security, however they also lead to decreased
performance.  If you favor performance over clean design, you should
possibly look for another cryptographic library. Unfortunately, there
are currently no other free cryptographic libraries for Ada we can
refer to.

The ACL is in the status of a "proof of concept". There might be the
possibility that sensible materials, such as the key, might still be
resident within the RAM after a program using the ACL has been
terminated. A storage pool dealing with this restriction is currently
being developed. Most of the other cryptographic libraries that share
this limitation do not inform about the possible weakness. Those
libraries should not be used as they can not be considered reliable.

The following subsumes the disadvantages of the ACL:
\begin{itemize}
\item missing cleanup of stack and heap
\item no "big-endian" support
\item bad performance
\end{itemize}

This documentation subsumes briefly the installation and the
topological structure.  Then it solely describes the API. Each package
and its API are introduced in a separate chapter. Each chapter
concludes with one or more examples.

\section{Installation HOWTO}
On a Linux system, the following packages are required to install the ACL:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{gnat}
\item \texttt{make}
\item \texttt{binutils}
\item \texttt{git}
\item \texttt{GCOV, LCOV (optional)}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Compilation}
The following commands can be used to get and compile the ACL as
well as the regression test included. \bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    # git clone git://github.com/cforler/Ada-Crypto-Library.git
    # cd Ada-Crypto-Library
    # make
    # make acltest
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Testing}
Before you actually install the ACL you should run the regression test
in order to make sure the ACL properly works on your computer
system. The following command sequence can be used to run the
regression test.\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    # cd test
    # ./test-tests
    # cd ..
\end{lstlisting}
Since the total regression test may last a few minutes, the tests are
additionally divided into five main categories, which can be run
seperately (Figure \ref{ACLTEST}): \texttt{Test-Big\_Number},
\texttt{Test-Symmetric\_Ciphers}, \texttt{Test-Asymmetric\_Ciphers},
\texttt{Test-Hash} and \texttt{Test-MISC}.

\subsubsection{Installation and De-installation}
If no errors were encountered during the regression test, the ACL can
be installed by issuing the following command:\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    # sudo make install
\end{lstlisting}
The following command can be used to remove the ACL:\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    # sudo make uninstall
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Recompilation}
The following commands can be used to recompile the ACL:\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    # make clean
    # make
    # make acltest
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Installiation and De-installation -Shared Library}
The ACL may be installed as a shared library (libacl.so) with the
following commands:\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    # make shared
    # make install-shared
\end{lstlisting}
The shared library can be de-installed with the following command:\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    # sudo make uninstall-shared
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Documentation}
The tetex-bin (latex) and the tetex-extra packages are needed to
install this documentation. The complete ACL documentation (german \&
english) can be generated with the following command:\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    # make doc
\end{lstlisting}
The documentation will be copied to
\texttt{/usr/local/share/doc/libadacrypt-dev} with the following command:\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    # sudo make install-doc
\end{lstlisting}
The documentation in \texttt{/usr/local/share/doc/libadacrypt-dev} can
be uninstalled with the following command:\bigskip
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    # sudo make uninstall-doc
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Adaptations}
The \texttt{Makefiles} can be found in the \texttt{src} directory. It can be used to
adapt the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item LIBDIR : installation path for the shared library.
\item INSTDIR : installation path for the ACL.
\end{itemize}
